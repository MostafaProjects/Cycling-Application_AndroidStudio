This Android cycling app allows administrators to create and manage cycling events, while users can register accounts, sign up for events, and provide feedback after participating. Data is securely stored in Firebase. Our group implemented a Firebase Authentication to handle user registration and login, and Firebase Realtime Database storing event details, user registrations, and event feedback. The app aims to create an engaging platform for cyclists to connect and share experiences, while allowing admins to organize and monitor events efficiently.
